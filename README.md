# Heart-Disease-Linear-Regression

An analysis and Linear Regression model for predicting the likelihood of Heart Disease.

## Results:

The variable most correlated with the target was *ST slope* with a correlation value of ~0.5.  However, the model prediction scores on the test set only ranged from 20% to 30% accuracy.  Thus, either further analysis is required or a different model must be used for this dataset.
